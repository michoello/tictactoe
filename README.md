The model finally consistently wins over classifier, thanks to the replay buffer added. Running almost 1000 iterations - appr 10 days.
Ideas to check:

- Check visually how the model plays. Is it looking humanly? No, not really. But better.
- compare outputs for the same board, but flipped and rotated. If the results are equal, then the model learnt symmetry of the gam, which is a proxy to its adequacy. Logits range to put more emphasis on confident values?
   - I previously thought it would be useful to introduce "normalized" board (out of 8 equivalent positions), and thus reduce the training by 8 times, but now it feels that having them all gives some room for analysis.
- try to train predefined epochs of 10 iterations and only compete after epochs are over. Switch to next version despite the results - optionally. Maybe it will help to achieve same results faster.
- involve multi model training, selection and mutations
- time to involve C, and maybe GPU even

Log:
models/with_replay_buffer/output.log

Note: for some reason models started to fill from 0 version again, so few very first versions are overwritten.

Additional restrictions to amount of victory did not help. The problem is seemingly in the model forgetting what it achieved before.
Time to add "memory" in form of replay buffer - store past games and use them in training.


# 2025-06-02

If we train many-many models, and then check them against classifier model, then there is a clear fluctuation
of scores. Some models are actually capacble of winning, and we need to stabilize and enforce this:
ChatGPT suggests to generate training batches using a sample of previous versions, and keep a buffer of past games.
It also says that a requirement of winning of all prev versions is too strict, but let's see:

```
$ for i in `seq 0 5`; do echo VERSION $i; python3 generate_games.py --mode play_many_games --crosses_model classifier:models/model_victory_only.json --zeroes_model player:models/from_zero/model-zeroes-$i.json; done

VERSION 0	Zeroes: 5 out of 100
VERSION 1	Zeroes: 1 out of 100
VERSION 2	Zeroes: 13 out of 100
VERSION 3	Zeroes: 11 out of 100
VERSION 4	Zeroes: 17 out of 100

Reworked in the fully zero based model, without pretrained classifier in the picture.
Along the way refactored the code so now every version is dumped to disk, and minimal amount of 
models is stored in memory.
That helped to fix few weird behaviors like crosses did not train, or zeroes "forgot" how to 
play with older crosses versions etc.
All of those were simple bugs, messed variables, one off errs etc etc. Very important to keep 
the code clean, so perhaps need to spend time on unittests.

Currently I see this weird "oscillation", wondeing if this is another bug, or a scientifially explainable
behavior lol:

```

Train longer or train smarter?
One thing to do is to play with all previous generations for sure, to force it to learn different behaviors. 
Maybe also bigger model next
And need to inspect closer what the game looks like -- crosses play way better for some reason


# 2025-05-15
Next I will try to train the model from zero level, without "classifier"
to compete against. If there will be progress, the "classifier"
model can be used as a test set -- i.e. something we know somewhat capable
of winning other zero-random model

# 2025-05-05
Multi iterational training. 
We start with zeroes as student.
Once a student wins over the teacher, we swap the roles. Now the teacher becomes the student, and previous student is used as a teacher.
So now we train crosses. And so on.
Kind of cool, seems like. But it does not work, as it looks like the students and teachers adopt to each other.
I ran it over night, and ended up with 700+ versions of students for both zeros and crosses.
However the version 700 of zero is consistenly loosing over version like 695 of the crosses, and version 1 as well.

As I am writing this, I realized that crosses, who start as a "classifier" model, keep being trained as classifier, not a player.
That may explain part of it :(
Let's try to fix it next and see what happens.

Next idea will be to compete a student with EACH of previous teachers, and generate training batch using all of them who win.
Will take a while, but seems promising.

```
python3 train_by_playing.py --save_to_model models/versioned/model
python3 generate_games.py --mode play_many_games \
    --crosses_model classifier:models/model_victory_only.json \
    --zeroes_model player:models/versioned/model-zeroes-4.4.json
```


# 2025-04-23
Added a competition into training, and stop when the student model starts to win.
It happens roughly after 10th epoch.
And it wins indeed, though I haven't checked how the game looks.
Next need to swap student and teacher and see if the progress goes on.

```
python3 train_by_playing.py --save_to_model models/model_barely_winning_zeroes.json
python3 generate_games.py --mode play_many_games --crosses_model classifier:models/model_victory_only.json --zeroes_model player:models/model_barely_winning_zeroes.json

```

Wow is not really a wow if you watch the games closely.
They all similar, very repetitive and quite useless.
The reason is that the model found imperfection of classifier based model and just started to put zeroes in a row
blocking the crosses and building 4-line first :)
If you retrain the classifier and try to run player against it, it will lose.
Useful insight for next step - the student must becomde a teacher at some point. To be continued.

# 2025-04-16
# Updating model params does not help, it looks like something is missing
# Observation:
#  - The model does not recognize a state "one step from losing", when e.g. 3 crosses in a row, and we play zero.
#    The model MUST put zero in the cell where 4th cross would be set, even if it does not lead to winning.
#
# Ideas:
#  - Maybe we can choose best step not only "aggressive", but also "defensive", when another player is to close to victory?
#    The problem is that this logic "leaks" game rules into the playing, which is not good for generalization
#  - Instead, we can explore states before "loss", and generate more boards, but that leaks rules into training. Not good again
#  - We can introduce a feedback loop into training, by making the trained model play games, to make it explore its mistakes.

# Went with the feedback loop idea and wow:

Ties: 0 out of 100

# It is trained to play zeroes only, but even for crosses significant progress! 
# Moving forward with that. Next we need to include "gaming competition" into the training, and as soon as student model starts to consistently win
# over the teacher, it should become a teacher itself. This can lead to some other side effects ("echo chamber") so let's see
